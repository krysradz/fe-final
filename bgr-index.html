I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
          No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
          I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
          You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
          I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
          You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

          They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
          No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
